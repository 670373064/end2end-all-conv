# Deep learning for breast cancer diagnosis

This repository was originally for my entry in the DREAM 2016 Digital Mammography challenge. In the challenge, I have developed a classifier based on residual net + probabilistic heatmap + gradient boosting trees. After the challenge ended, I switched the direction into developing an end-to-end training strategy to directly predict cancer status at whole-image level.

For my entry in the challenge, see: https://www.synapse.org/LiShenDMChallenge. I ended up ranking #12 in sub-challenge 1 and #10 in sub-challenge 2.
